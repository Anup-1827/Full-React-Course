<h1>How Primitive and Non-Primitive Variables are handle using state in React?</h1>
<h3>Answer:--</h3>
<b>Primitive</b>
<ul>
<li>Variables include number, string, boolean, Null, Undefined.</li>
<li>These are immutable and compared by values</li>
<li>Updating the state with primitive value triggers re-render if the new value is different from the current state</li>
</ul>

<b>Non-Primitive</b>
<ul>
<li>Variables include object, arrays and function</li>
<li>These are mutable and compared by reference</li>
<li>Updating the state with non-primitve value requires a new reference. Simply modifing the existing object or array won't trigger re-render. Beacuse react uses shallow comparision</li>
<li>Shallow comparision checks for reference change. Simply changing the existing object or array won't trigger re-render as reference is not changing</li>
</ul>
