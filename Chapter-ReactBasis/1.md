# What is Reconciler?
+ Reconciler is an internal mechanism that determines how virtual DOM (lighweight version of real dom) is transformed into Real DOM
<div class="mainDiv">
<h2> 
Reconciliation is an algorithm which uses the concept of virtual DOM to differentiate between the two trees to know which part has changed and only render the changed part rather than updating the whole DOM
</h2>

<h1>React Element</h1>
<ul>
<li>" $$type of" key the react element is for security purpose</li>
</ul>

<h1>React Component</h1>
<p>React Component can be of two type functional based and class based. If it is functional based component the output is the returned value of the function. If it is class based component then output is the returned value of the render method.
</p>

<h1>The Diff Algorithm</h1>
<ul>
<li>React can't just re-render the whole tree</li>
<li>React compares the tree and finds the smallest number of operation to transform one tree into other</li>
<li>This is handled by Diff Algorithm</li>
<li><b>Tree Diffing</b></li>
<li>Tree Diffing takes time complexity of O(N^3)</li>
<li>Comparing each node in tree with T1 and T2 takes O(N^2) operation</li>
<li>Also, for each pair of node, the algorithm may need to compare their respective subtrees, leading to additional nested comparision. Which leads to time complexity of O(N^3) </li>

<b>React “heuristic” algorithm</b>
<li>Heuristic algorithm refers to the reconciliation process that react uses to efficiently update the user interface when state of the component changes</li>
<li>This algorithm is designed to minimize the steps to update the DOM</li>
</ul>

<b>Key Principles of React's Reconciliation Algorithm</b>
<ul>
<li>Element Comparison</li>
<li>Component Type Comparison</li>
<li>Key Prop</li>
</ul>

1. <b>Element Comparison</b>
<ul>
<li>Same Type:- If the elements are same like (div) then react reuses the existing DOM, and change the only attribute</li>
<li>Diff Type:- If the elements are diff then react destroys the existing element and creates new DOM node from Scratch</li>
</ul>

2. <b>Component Type Comparison</b>
<ul>
<li>Same Component:-- If the components are same then React uses the same component or instance, by preserving it's state</li>
<li>Different Component:-- If the components are diff the react unmount the old component and mounts a new component </li>
</ul>

3. <b>Key Props</b>
<ul>
<li>React uses key props to identify the element in the list added, changed or removed</li>
<li>When comparing children of a node, React first matches element with same key, the move accordingly or removes it. This prevents re-rendering</li>
</ul>
